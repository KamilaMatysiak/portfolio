        description: "In March 2012 I’ve grabbed my family camera and decided to take some pictures of stray cats and that’s how it all has begun. Since then, my folder filled with hundred of files. \n \n I love to take photos of an animals or makro photos. Lately I don’t have time to photograph and more often just take photos from my trips with phone camera so I can take one bag less and don’t have to worry about theft or damaging the lenses. \n \n I hope soon I will find some time to go back to my passion and do it proper way again :)",

        description: `My first contact with Figma was in 2021 on UI/UX classes. Right now I have around 10 drafts in my library. I havea lot of ideas and get inspired by a lot of things. I would loveto develop in that direction, so I took some courses. I often look at some design tips or figma tutorials. I also get to know some of UX tools like Miro and FigJam\n\nI want to expand my experience of Sketch and Adobe Xd but I don’t have MacOS nor money yet. Despite that, I’m open to learn them in the future :)`,

It helps me motivate and focus. \n \nI’ve been playing guitar for 13 years. I also tried to learn playing piano, but it was too hard for a self-taught. Beside this, I love to sing and sing-along to every hit I know.`,
